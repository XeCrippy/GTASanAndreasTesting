# GTA San Andreas teleport testing
Just some testing I figured I'd share

* I've been unable to find a static pointer for player coordinates so I wrote a little ppc function to pull the value from the register on execution and write it to free memory
* God mode one hit kill hasn't been fully tested. I did fix a few issues with it so now you won't die inside buildings and you won't take damage from bmx/motorcycle crashes but you will do on vehicle explosion
