# GTA San Andreas teleport testing
Just some testing I figured I'd share

* THIS IS TU1 OR WHATEVER THE LATEST VERSION ON XBOX UNITY IS. WILL UPDATE ASAP

* I've been unable to find a static pointer for player coordinates so I wrote a little ppc function to pull the value from the register on execution and write it to free memory
* God mode one hit kill hasn't been tested much. I died while inside the police station so that's one bug at least. Enemies in vehicles seem to not take damage as well so it'll need some work. I do know it's not returning the function at the correct point so hopefully that will be an easy fix.
